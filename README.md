# Numerical-Analysis-Class-Assignments
In this class, we cover the following numerical methods:
Root finding: Newton's method, secant method, bisection method
Matrix decomposition: LU decomposition of matrices, building Householder matrices, QR factorization of matrices
Matrix norm: induced matrix norm, 1-norm, 2-norm, infinite-norm
Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors: power method, inverse power method
Polynomial interpolation: Lagrange interpolation, Hermite interpolation
L2 approximation and orthogonal polynomials: Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, Newton-Cotes(composite Trapezoid rule, composite Simpson's rule), Gaussian quadrature
And we used matlab to realize these methods in codes.
